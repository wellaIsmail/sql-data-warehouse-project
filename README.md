Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
![data_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc0d51a9-5c4a-4f68-afe5-27a10333c8c4)


Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
